# Squid Configuration Template for Hardening

# Ensure Squid runs as a dedicated sandbox user
cache_effective_user squid_user
cache_effective_group squid_group

# Change the default port and bind to a specific IP address
http_port 172.16.0.15:9584

# Set the size limits for objects in the cache
maximum_object_size 4096 MB
minimum_object_size 0 KB

# Use trusted DNS servers to avoid redirection and DNS spoofing attacks
dns_nameservers 10.0.0.1 192.172.0.4

# Set the maximum size of request headers to prevent DoS attacks
request_header_max_size 64 KB

# Define the maximum time a client can be connected to prevent resource exhaustion
client_lifetime 1 day

# Set the timeout for idle persistent connections to minimize the risk of DoS attacks
pconn_timeout 1 minute

# Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Access Controls
# Define network ranges and trusted ports
acl mynetwork src 172.16.0.0/12
acl trusted_ports port 80 443 8080
http_access allow mynetwork trusted_ports

# Default deny rule for unspecified access
http_access deny all

# Authentication settings
auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/passwords
auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server
auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours
acl authenticated proxy_auth REQUIRED
http_access allow authenticated

# Disable caching completely for security reasons
cache deny all

# Logging settings
access_log /var/log/squid/access.log squid
cache_log /var/log/squid/cache.log

# Security-related settings
# Hide client IP addresses with forwarded_for and via headers off
forwarded_for off
via off

# Disable ICP, HTCP, and SNMP to reduce the attack surface
icp_port 0
htcp_port 0
snmp_port 0

# Ensure Squid ignores unknown nameservers to prevent DNS spoofing attacks
ignore_unknown_nameserver on

# Directory for coredump files should be outside of the critical system partitions
coredump_dir /var/spool/squid_coredumps

# Additional hardening options can be added below as needed
